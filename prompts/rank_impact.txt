RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by IMPACT POTENTIAL

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Lowest impact (marginal improvements, minor optimizations)
Rank {count} = Highest impact (transformational, game-changing results)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "DevOps culture" → near {count} (high impact)
- "Naming conventions" → near 1 (low impact)
- "Code reviews" → middle (moderate impact)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: business value, transformational effect

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array

JSON Response:
