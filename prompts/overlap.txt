You are analyzing the overlap between two product development methods.

Methods have OVERLAP when they address similar or overlapping problems, even if they approach them differently:
- They target the same or similar problem spaces
- They produce similar types of outcomes
- They could be alternatives to each other
- Example: "Risk Assessment Matrix" and "Risk-Adjusted Backlog" both address risk management

Methods have LOW OVERLAP when:
- They address entirely different concerns
- They apply to different phases or contexts
- They serve complementary rather than overlapping purposes

**Method 1:**
Name: {method1_name}
Description: {method1_desc}

**Method 2:**
Name: {method2_name}
Description: {method2_desc}

**Question: How much do these methods overlap in terms of the problems they address?**

Answer with:
1. Overlap level: HIGH OVERLAP, MODERATE OVERLAP, LOW OVERLAP, or NO OVERLAP
2. Brief reasoning (2-3 sentences explaining what aspects overlap or don't)

Keep your response concise and direct.
