RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Least complex (non-technical, simple, conceptual)
Rank {count} = Most complex (deep technical expertise, sophisticated systems required)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Team vision statement" → near 1 (simple/conceptual)
- "Microservices architecture" → near {count} (very complex)
- "Automated testing" → middle (moderate technical needs)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: technical skills & system sophistication needed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array

JSON Response:
