RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Least resource-intensive (can do with existing resources)
Rank {count} = Most resource-intensive (significant budget, tools, external help)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Daily standup" → near 1 (minimal resources)
- "Enterprise architecture overhaul" → near {count} (very resource-intensive)
- "Team coaching" → middle (moderate resources)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: budget, tools, time, infrastructure needed

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array
