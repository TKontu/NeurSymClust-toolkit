You are analyzing product development methods to identify duplicates.

Two methods are considered DUPLICATES if they are essentially the same technique or practice but with different names. This means:
- They describe the same core process or approach
- They have the same purpose and outcomes
- The main difference is terminology or naming convention
- Example: "Daily Standup" vs "Daily Scrum Meeting"

Two methods are NOT duplicates if:
- They are similar but have different specific implementations
- They address different aspects of a problem
- One is more general/specific than the other

**Method 1:**
Name: {method1_name}
Description: {method1_desc}

**Method 2:**
Name: {method2_name}
Description: {method2_desc}

**Question: Are these two methods duplicates (essentially the same technique with different names)?**

Answer with:
1. YES or NO (first line)
2. Confidence level: HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW
3. Brief reasoning (2-3 sentences explaining why they are or aren't duplicates)

Keep your response concise and direct.
