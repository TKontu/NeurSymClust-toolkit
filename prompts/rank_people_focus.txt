RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by PEOPLE FOCUS

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Least people-focused (pure technical/systems, automation-driven)
Rank {count} = Most people-focused (entirely about people, culture, leadership)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Servant leadership" → near {count} (entirely people)
- "Automated testing" → near 1 (pure technical)
- "Pair programming" → middle (balanced)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: human interaction vs technical/system elements

OUTPUT FORMAT:

- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array
