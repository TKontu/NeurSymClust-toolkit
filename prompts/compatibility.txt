You are analyzing whether two product development methods are compatible for use together in a project toolkit.

Two methods are COMPATIBLE if they are COMPLEMENTARY - they address different aspects of a problem and can work together effectively:
- They cover different phases, activities, or concerns
- Using both provides broader coverage than either alone
- They don't contradict or conflict with each other
- Example: "Sprint Planning" (planning phase) + "Daily Standup" (daily coordination) are highly compatible

Two methods have LOW compatibility if:
- They contradict each other (e.g., opposing philosophies)
- They address the exact same problem in conflicting ways
- Using both would create confusion or redundancy

**Method 1:**
Name: {method1_name}
Description: {method1_desc}

**Method 2:**
Name: {method2_name}
Description: {method2_desc}

**Question: How compatible are these methods for use together?**

Answer with:
1. Compatibility level: HIGHLY COMPATIBLE, COMPATIBLE, SOMEWHAT COMPATIBLE, or INCOMPATIBLE
2. Brief reasoning (2-3 sentences explaining why, focusing on complementarity and potential conflicts)

Keep your response concise and direct.
