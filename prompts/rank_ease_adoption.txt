RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by EASE OF ADOPTION

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Hardest to adopt (steep learning curve, extensive training needed)
Rank {count} = Easiest to adopt (intuitive, minimal training, start immediately)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Test-driven development" → near 1 (requires new skills, practice)
- "Daily standup meeting" → near {count} (learn in 5 minutes)
- "Sprint planning" → middle (some practice needed)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: individual/team learning curve, training time, technical skills, intuitiveness

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array

JSON Response:
