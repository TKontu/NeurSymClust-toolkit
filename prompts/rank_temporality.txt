RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by TEMPORALITY

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Most immediate (hours/days impact, quick results)
Rank {count} = Most evolutionary (years impact, long-term cultural change)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Bug fix" → near 1 (immediate)
- "Learning organization culture" → near {count} (evolutionary)
- "Sprint cycle" → middle (weeks/months)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: how long until meaningful results?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array
