RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by TIME TO VALUE

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Slowest (takes years to see meaningful results)
Rank {count} = Fastest (immediate or near-immediate results)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Culture transformation" → near 1 (very slow)
- "Daily standup" → near {count} (very fast)
- "Team coaching" → middle (moderate)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: how quickly does it deliver value after implementation?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array
