You are analyzing product development methods to assess how well they fit into predefined categories.

**Method to Analyze:**
Name: {method_name}
Description: {method_description}

**Assigned Category:**
{assigned_category_name}: {assigned_category_description}

**All Available Categories:**
{all_categories}

**Task:**
Evaluate how well this method fits into its assigned category and whether it represents dimensions not well covered by the existing category system.

**Analysis Instructions:**
1. **Fit Quality**: Rate how well the method fits its assigned category (1-10 scale)
   - 9-10: Perfect fit, method is quintessential example of this category
   - 7-8: Good fit, method clearly belongs to this category
   - 5-6: Moderate fit, method partially aligns but has aspects outside the category
   - 3-4: Poor fit, method only tangentially relates to the category
   - 1-2: Very poor fit, method doesn't really belong in this category

2. **Alternative Categories**: Could this method fit better in a different existing category? If yes, which one(s) and why?

3. **Missing Dimensions**: Does this method represent important product development dimensions that are NOT well covered by any of the 11 existing categories?

4. **Category Suggestions**: If the fit is poor (≤6) or the method represents uncovered dimensions, suggest what type of high-level category would better capture this method's essence.

**Response Format:**
Provide your analysis in this exact format:

FIT_SCORE: [number 1-10]
FIT_LEVEL: [excellent/good/moderate/poor/very_poor]
ALTERNATIVE_CATEGORY: [category_id or "none"]
MISSING_DIMENSION: [yes/no]
DIMENSION_DESCRIPTION: [brief description of missing dimension, or "none"]
CATEGORY_SUGGESTION: [suggested category name, or "none"]
REASONING: [2-3 sentences explaining your assessment]

**Example Response:**
FIT_SCORE: 8
FIT_LEVEL: good
ALTERNATIVE_CATEGORY: none
MISSING_DIMENSION: no
DIMENSION_DESCRIPTION: none
CATEGORY_SUGGESTION: none
REASONING: This method clearly focuses on iterative development practices with regular feedback cycles. It aligns well with the iterative_development category's emphasis on incremental progress and adaptation. No significant dimensions are missing from the current category system for this method.
