RANKING TASK: Order these {count} methods by PROCESS FOCUS

SCALE:
Rank 1 = Least process-focused (ad-hoc, informal, flexible)
Rank {count} = Most process-focused (rigid procedures, standardized, documented)

COMPARISON ANCHORS:
- "Six Sigma" → near {count} (rigid process)
- "Open innovation" → near 1 (ad-hoc)
- "Definition of Done" → middle (semi-structured)

METHODS:
{methods_list}

RULES:
1. Use ALL ranks 1-{count} exactly once (no ties)
2. Spread across full range
3. Think: standardization, documentation, procedural rigor

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Return ONLY the JSON array: [[method_number, rank],[method_number, rank], ...]
- NO comments, explanations, reasoning, or markdown formatting
- NO `//` comments inside the JSON
- Just the pure JSON array
